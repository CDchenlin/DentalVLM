## :label: TODO 

- [ ] Release annotations.
- [ ] Release inference code.
- [ ] Release checkpoints.
- [ ] Release trainning code.

## Installation

As we utilized the MMDetection implementation of GroundingDINO as our base model. Please refer to [Installation](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) and the [Config File](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/main/configs/grounding_dino) for installation instructions.

## :hearts: Acknowledgement

Our model is related to [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/) and [MMDetction](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). Thanks for their great work!

We also thank all the dentists who have helped to annotate the data.
